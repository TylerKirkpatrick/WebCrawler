Tyler Kirkpatrick's Web Crawler

Instructions:

    git clone ...

    cd WebCrawler

Python3 is required to run this project

Install BeautifulSoup4:

    pip install BeautifulSoup4

To run:

Windows:

    py -3 main.py

or

Mac:

    python3 main.py

Troubleshooting: If you receive an error similar to "ImportError: No module named bs4 in Windows" even after running the "pip install BeautifulSoup4",
then you probably need to navigate to the Scripts folder where you have Python3 installed. For me it was: "C:\Users<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts".
Once you're there, run pip install BeautifulSoup4
